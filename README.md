# PiecewiseLinearOpt
A package for modeling optimization problems containing piecewise linear functions. Current support is for (the graphs of) continuous univariate functions.

This package is an accompaniment to a paper entitled [_Nonconvex piecewise linear functions: Advanced formulations and simple modeling tools_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00050), by Joey Huchette and Juan Pablo Vielma.

This package offers helper functions for the [JuMP algebraic modeling language](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl).

Consider a piecewise linear function. The function is described in terms of the breakpoints between pieces, and the function value at those breakpoints.

Consider a JuMP model

```julia
using JuMP, PiecewiseLinearOpt
m = Model()
@variable(m, x)
```

To model the graph of a piecewise linear function ``f(x)``, take ``d`` as some set of breakpoints along the real line, and ``fd = [f(x) for x in d]`` as the corresponding function values. You can model this function in JuMP using the following function:

```julia
z = piecewiselinear(m, x, d, fd)
@objective(m, Min, z) # minimize f(x)
```

For another example, think of a piecewise linear approximation for for the function $f(x,y) = exp(x+y)$:

```julia
using JuMP, PiecewiseLinearOpt
m = Model()
@variable(m, x)
@variable(m, y)

z = piecewiselinear(m, x, y, 0:0.1:1, 0:0.1:1, (u,v) -> exp(u+v))
@objective(m, Min, z)
```

Current support is limited to modeling the graph of a continuous piecewise linear function, either univariate or bivariate, with the goal of adding support for the epigraphs of lower semicontinuous piecewise linear functions.

Supported univariate formulations:

* Convex combination (``:CC``)
* Multiple choice (``:MC``)
* Native SOS2 branching (``:SOS2``)
* Incremental (``:Incremental``)
* Logarithmic (``:Logarithmic``; default)
* Disaggregated Logarithmic (``:DisaggLogarithmic``)
* Binary zig-zag (``:ZigZag``)
* General integer zig-zag (``:ZigZagInteger``)

Supported bivariate formulations for entire constraint:

* Convex combination (``:CC``)
* Multiple choice (``:MC``)
* Dissaggregated Logarithmic (``:DisaggLogarithmic``)

Also, you can use any univariate formulation for bivariate functions as well. They will be used to impose two axis-aligned SOS2 constraints, along with the "6-stencil" formulation for the triangle selection portion of the constraint. See the associated paper for more details. In particular, the following are also acceptable bivariate formulation choices:

* Native SOS2 branching (``:SOS2``)
* Incremental (``:Incremental``)
* Logarithmic (``:Logarithmic``)
* Binary zig-zag (``:ZigZag``)
* General integer zig-zag (``:ZigZagInteger``)
